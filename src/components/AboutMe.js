                    <p>I currently reside in Santa Barbara, California, and frequent between here and the Bay Area. After graduating from University of California, Santa Barbara with a degree in Biology, I threw in my scrubs to study web development at Lambda School.</p>
                    <p>I hope to use the experience I’ve gained from working with people in medical and professional settings (and of course my new CS skills) to join a startup centered around biomedical or lifestyle products.</p>
                    <p>I also dabble in hot yoga</p>
